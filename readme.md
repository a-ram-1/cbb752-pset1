## CBB 752 Assignment 1

I'm implementing the Smith-Waterman algorithm from scratch. You can see the assignment specs [here](http://cbb752b21.gersteinlab.org/assignments). 

### System requirements

* Python 3
* git [if you don't have git try running ```pip install git```]


If you want to install and run this, run the following: 

```
git clone git://github.com/a-ram-1/cbb752-pset1.git
```

Enclosed are the following files: 

* _blosum62.txt_ -- the blosum62 scoring matrix
* _input.txt_ -- the input file
* _sample-input1.txt_ -- a sample input file
* _sample-input2.txt_ -- another sample input file
* _sample-output1.txt_ -- what the output should look like if you run the algorithm with _sample-input1.txt_
* _sample-output2.txt_ -- what the output should look like if you run the algorithm with _sample-input2.txt_
* _pset1.py_ -- code for pset 1
